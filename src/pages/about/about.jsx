            <p>
              Our journey began in 2020 when four friends recognized a common problem:
              despite the abundance of campus events, many students struggled to discover
              activities that aligned with their interests and schedules.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alexandra, Marcus, Priya, and David met during a hackathon and decided to
              build a solution. What started as a simple events board quickly evolved into
              a comprehensive platform for connecting students with campus life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, our platform serves thousands of students across multiple campuses,
              helping them discover events, connect with peers, and make the most of their
              college experience.
